	ZK Widget Package Definition

	ZK will load javascript by WPD , (i.e. zk.wpd , zul.inp.wpd ...etc )
	that means all the widget definition in the package will be packed into single file in runtime ,
	and be loaded when the component is accessed.

	== Tip in advance ==
	  To prevent too many client Javascript requests for speeding up the loading,
	  sometimes you will consider to merge multiple packages in lang-addon.xml .
	  (@see lang-addon.xml)

	  We are not promising anything about the merging config ,
	  you have to check the order and dependency carefully when you merge it,
	  especially the dependency for "zul.lang" , it couldn't be merged with any package.
	====


	Options:

	* depends

		If you are developing your own package ,
		and you need to access a existing widget (ex.zul.db.Datebox)  ,
		which your widget inherit from or need to instance for ,

		that means your package count on the package (ex. "zul.db") ,
		then you have to specify the package as "depends".

		i.e.
		<package name="my.package.name" language="xul/html" depends="zul.db">
			<widget name="MyWidget" />
		</package>

		You might depend multiple packages , use comma to separate them.
		i.e. depends="zk.fmt,zul.inp"

		When ZK try to load the package , it will load the dependency first.

-->
<package name="test" language="xul/html">

	<!--

	== Tip in advance ==
		You could also specify a general javascript file here,
		it's not always required to be a widget definition.

		For example , if you try to wrap some jQuery plug-in as a Widget ,
		you might need to load some plug-in source code before you writing your widget.

		Just place JS files in the package folder , and write the definition
		<script src="js-file-a.js" />
		<script src="js-file-b.js" />
	====

	<widget name="Mylabel" />
</package>
