= Introduction =

Because Run-Jetty-Run(RJR) use full project classpath to run the web application, 
and we did some finetune job for maven by default.


*So you could use RJR to run Maven web based web application WITHOUT ANY CONFIGURATION.*

Simple click "Run Jetty" and then it works.


Forgot those configuration in pom.xml or WTP and save your time,
use RJR to run it today.


For more details about how to run RJR, please referenced to GettingStarted  .


Try it , you will love it. ;)
