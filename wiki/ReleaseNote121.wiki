= Notice =

If you run a existing project and get a ClassNotFound Exception in bootstrap , it's caused by you customized the RJR classpath in "Run Configuration" , you might need to restore default entrys to get newer jetty package works.

We change the RJR bootstrap/Jetty jars classpath implementation to use container at 1.2.1,so it's last time we need to worry about this.


= Next Milestone =

Here we list the defects we are going to do in version 1.2.2 ;
