#Nightly current version and feature/issues

= Introduction =

We create a nightly build for those still testing feature , 
for example , Jetty7 or Jetty8 support is a big milestone and need more testing.

It's very welcome to report the bug from nightly build.

= Latest Nightly version =

1.3.1.20111219


= Nightly Update Site =

http://run-jetty-run.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updatesite-nightly


= Outlines = 

1.*New UI for web classpath in run configuration!*
    You could now enable specific classpath to be loaded or not!

2.*New UI for source monitor list in run configuration!*
    It's a ability to scan files in the list , if those files is add/changed/removed , the jetty server will automatically restart.

    It was the source scanner feature ,in past it's only for target output folder , but now you are able to add your own files if you need!
    
    We will also scan all XML files in WEB-INF by default!
    That means web.xml , application-context.xml and some files else will be in the list by default , sure you could disable them in the new UI if you don't need it.

3.*Add support for the newer Maven for Eclipse(M2Eclipse) plugin in Eclipse 3.7*.
    In Eclispe 3.7, the M2E changed a lot for the package name and also some details configs , we was doing some support feature for old M2E since 1.3.0 , and now we also have well support with new M2E!

4.*Now we have better servlet3 support*.  
    In 1.3.1 we try to supprot annotation , but it's still not working for web-fragment and META-INF/resource folder since the restriction of the Jetty8 implementation , it's only scanning the WEB-INF/classes and WEB-INF/lib/`*`.jar .

    They didn't consider for those classpath that's not in regular classpath , but we use Maven or referenced to other project very often , so that's a big trouble for Eclipse developement.
     
    In 1.3.2 , we use our own configuration classes to fully support those feature!
