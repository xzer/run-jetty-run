* This document is a bit overdue for current version , we will update this document soon. *

= Introduction =
We are going to talk about the Classpath details in Run-Jetty-Run.


There are two classpaths we need to discuss it here.

----

===Jetty Container Classpath ===

Used for our bootstrap . It's seldom changed in general development case.

----

===Web App classpath ===

In a general wab app , it's the classes/jars in WEB-INF/classes and WEB-INF/lib

== Web App Classpath Details ==


=== How to check what classpath RJR is loading ? ===

It will load the all the Classpath in your Java Build Path , 
it locate at project context menu -> properties -> Java Build Path.


You could also check/edit the classpath that RJR should load in *Webapp Classpath Tab* of RJR RunConfiguration.

=== How to add new classpaths to web context ? ===


There's two way to change web context classpath

  * Change project configuration in project properties

Or 
  * Click *Webapp Classpath* > * User Custom classpath * in the RunConfiguration

  * Click "add Projects"/"Add class folders"/ "add Jars" /"add external jars" as your need to add new classpath.


_Note: It's better to change the project classpath instead of changing classpath of RJR Configuration._

----

=== How to exclude some unused jars ===

  * Uncheck the checkbox in front of jars.

  * Note: You can't uncheck a container forever,we will help you uncheck  all the jars in the container , but if you add new jars to the container , it's still default be checked.

== Jetty Classpath Details ==

(It's the view since the 1.2.1 and a bit different in past,we use container to handle the Classpath to avoid the absolute path.)


  * It's located in Run-Jetty-Run Run configuration , and only releated to the Jetty Bundle.(6.1.6 in past , 6.1.26 after 1.2 )  
    * You could replace it with any Jetty6 version one by one.(I haven't test it with Jetty 7 / Jetty 8. )

  * Run-Jetty-Run bootstrap jar for a Jetty launcher in our implementation. (It's a must have.)



Note: * Usually you don't need to add any container Classpath here * , all the framework/lib like Spring/Hibernate/Struts , 
it's web app stuff and should be placed in WebApp classpath, not containers.

#1 Actually it's not loading the source folder .
if you do have  resources or java classes in source , but you got a ClassNotFound or 404 ,
please check if your target output folder exist the mapping class or resource,
sometime clean the project may make it work.(It's usually a defect for Eclipse builder.)


If it's not working as expect , please post a bug.
